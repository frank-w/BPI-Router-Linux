	  Include support for 10G SerDes which can be found on MT7988.
	  If this kernel should run on SoCs with 10 GBit/s Ethernet you
	  will need to select this option to use GMAC2 and GMAC3 with
	  external PHYs, SFP(+) cages in 10000Base-R, 5000Base-R or
	  USXGMII interface mode.

	  Note that as the 2500Base-X/1000Base-X/Cisco SGMII SerDes PCS
	  unit (MediaTek LynxI) in MT7988 is connected via the new 10GE
	  SerDes, you will also need to select this option in case you
