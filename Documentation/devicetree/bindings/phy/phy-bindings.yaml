    description:
      An array of physical data lane indexes. Position of an entry determines
      the logical lane number, while the value of an entry indicates controller
      or port mapped to this lane controllers should start by 1 as 0 indicates
      not used or disabled lane.
      e.g. for 2-lane bus we could have
      "data-lanes = <1 2>;"
      where hardware lane 0 is mapped to first controller/port and lane 1 is
      second controller/port.

  "#phy-cells":
    description: Number of cells in a PHY specifier;  The meaning of all those
      cells is defined by the binding for the phy node. The PHY provider can
      use the values in cells to find the appropriate PHY.

  phy-supply:
    description:
      Phandle to a regulator that provides power to the PHY. This
      regulator will be managed during the PHY power on/off sequence.
